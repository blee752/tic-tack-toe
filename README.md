The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript project #2
## Description ## 

Designed and created a browser version of Tic Tac Toe. The purpose of the project was to use the Module pattern and the Factory Pattern to build and design objects to incorporate game logic. 

Would like to come back later to implement an ai difficulty with the hard mode implementing the Minmax algorithm.
